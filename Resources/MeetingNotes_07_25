Group Assignments:

Group 1 (Server): Take the server.py and client.py code from https://github.com/apps4sj/TwitterHelper/tree/main/Exploration and add a command to the server. This can be something like “TWEET hello” or “SEARCH monkey.” Make the server send a message back to the client in response to those commands.

Group 2 (Android Studio): Work through this tutorial and try to add something of your own creation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCrhddpsgKU&ab_channel=ProfessorDK
